"""
``graph_tool.collection`` - Dataset collection
----------------------------------------------

This module contains an assortment of useful networks.

.. data:: data

    Dictionary containing :class:`~graph_tool.Graph` objects, indexed by the
    name of the graph. This is a "lazy" dictionary, i.e. it only loads the
    graphs from disk when the items are accessed for the first time.  The
    description for each graph is given in the :data:`descriptions` dictionary,
    or alternatively in the ``"description"`` graph property which accompanies
    each graph object.

Examples
========

    >>> g = gt.collection.data["karate"]
    >>> print(g)
    <Graph object, undirected, with 34 vertices and 78 edges at 0x9ca5d90>


.. data:: descriptions

    Dictionary with a short description and source information on each graph.

    A summary, with some extra information, is available in the following table.
