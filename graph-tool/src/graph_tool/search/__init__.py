``graph_tool.search`` - Search algorithms
-----------------------------------------

This module includes several search algorithms, which are customizable to
arbitrary purposes. It is mostly a wrapper around the Visitor interface of the
`Boost Graph Library <http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/graph/doc/visitor_concepts.html>`_,
and the respective search functions.


Summary
+++++++

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   bfs_search
   dfs_search
   dijkstra_search
   bellman_ford_search
   astar_search
   BFSVisitor
   DFSVisitor
   DijkstraVisitor
   BellmanFordVisitor
   AStarVisitor
   StopSearch

Examples
++++++++

In this module, most documentation examples will make use of the network
:download:`search_example.xml <search_example.xml>`, shown below.

>>> g = gt.load_graph("search_example.xml")
>>> name = g.vp["name"]
>>> weight = g.ep["weight"]
>>> pos = g.vp["pos"]
>>> gt.graph_draw(g, pos, vertex_text=name, vertex_font_size=12, vertex_shape="double_circle",
...               vertex_fill_color="#729fcf", vertex_pen_width=3,
...               edge_pen_width=weight, output="search_example.pdf")
<...>

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   gt.graph_draw(g, pos=pos, vertex_text=name, vertex_font_size=12, vertex_shape="double_circle",
                 vertex_fill_color="#729fcf", vertex_pen_width=3,
                 edge_pen_width=weight, output="search_example.png")

.. figure:: search_example.*
   :alt: search example
   :align: center

   This is the network used in the examples below. The width of the edges
   correspond to the values of the "weight" property map.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : :class:`~graph_tool.Graph`
        Graph to be used.
    source : :class:`~graph_tool.Vertex`
        Source vertex.
    visitor : :class:`~graph_tool.search.BFSVisitor` (optional, default: ``BFSVisitor()``)
        A visitor object that is invoked at the event points inside the

    Notes
    -----

    A breadth-first traversal visits vertices that are closer to the source
    before visiting vertices that are further away. In this context "distance"
    is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path from the source
    vertex.

    The time complexity is :math:`O(V + E)`.

    The pseudo-code for the BFS algorithm is listed below, with the annotated
    event points, for which the given visitor object will be called with the
    appropriate method.

    Examples
    --------

    We must define what should be done during the search by subclassing
    :class:`~graph_tool.search.BFSVisitor`, and specializing the appropriate
    methods. In the following we will keep track of the distance from the root,
    and the predecessor tree.

    .. testcode::

        class VisitorExample(gt.BFSVisitor):

            def __init__(self, name, pred, dist):
                self.name = name
                self.pred = pred
                self.dist = dist

            def discover_vertex(self, u):
                print("-->", self.name[u], "has been discovered!")

            def examine_vertex(self, u):
                print(self.name[u], "has been examined...")

            def tree_edge(self, e):
                self.pred[e.target()] = int(e.source())
                self.dist[e.target()] = self.dist[e.source()] + 1

    With the above class defined, we can perform the BFS search as follows.

    >>> dist = g.new_vertex_property("int")
    >>> pred = g.new_vertex_property("int")
    >>> gt.bfs_search(g, g.vertex(0), VisitorExample(name, pred, dist))
    --> Bob has been discovered!
    Bob has been examined...
    --> Eve has been discovered!
    --> Chuck has been discovered!
    --> Carlos has been discovered!
    --> Isaac has been discovered!
    Eve has been examined...
    --> Carol has been discovered!
    --> Imothep has been discovered!
    Chuck has been examined...
    Carlos has been examined...
    --> Alice has been discovered!
    Isaac has been examined...
    Carol has been examined...
    Imothep has been examined...
    Alice has been examined...
    --> Oscar has been discovered!
    --> Dave has been discovered!
    Oscar has been examined...
    Dave has been examined...
    >>> print(dist.a)

    Notes
    -----

    When possible, a depth-first traversal chooses a vertex adjacent to the
    current vertex to visit next. If all adjacent vertices have already been
    discovered, or there are no adjacent vertices, then the algorithm backtracks
    to the last vertex that had undiscovered neighbors. Once all reachable
    vertices have been visited, the algorithm selects from any remaining
    undiscovered vertices and continues the traversal. The algorithm finishes
    when all vertices have been visited.

    The time complexity is :math:`O(V + E)`.

    The pseudo-code for the DFS algorithm is listed below, with the annotated
    event points, for which the given visitor object will be called with the

    Notes
    -----

    Dijkstra's algorithm finds all the shortest paths from the source vertex to
    every other vertex by iteratively "growing" the set of vertices S to which
    it knows the shortest path. At each step of the algorithm, the next vertex
    added to S is determined by a priority queue. The queue contains the
    vertices in V - S prioritized by their distance label, which is the length
    of the shortest path seen so far for each vertex. The vertex u at the top of
    the priority queue is then added to S, and each of its out-edges is relaxed:
    if the distance to u plus the weight of the out-edge (u,v) is less than the
    distance label for v then the estimated distance for vertex v is
    reduced. The algorithm then loops back, processing the next vertex at the
    top of the priority queue. The algorithm finishes when the priority queue is
    empty.

    The time complexity is :math:`O(V \log V)`.

    The pseudo-code for Dijkstra's algorithm is listed below, with the annotated
    event points, for which the given visitor object will be called with the
    appropriate method.

    Examples

    We must define what should be done during the search by subclassing
    :class:`~graph_tool.search.DijkstraVisitor`, and specializing the
    appropriate methods. In the following we will keep track of the discover
    time, and the predecessor tree.

    .. testcode::

        class VisitorExample(gt.DijkstraVisitor):

            def __init__(self, name, time):
                self.name = name
                self.time = time
                self.last_time = 0

            def discover_vertex(self, u):
                print("-->", self.name[u], "has been discovered!")
                self.time[u] = self.last_time

    Notes
    -----

    The Bellman-Ford algorithm [bellman-ford]_ solves the single-source shortest
    paths problem for a graph with both positive and negative edge weights. If
    you only need to solve the shortest paths problem for positive edge weights,
    :func:`~graph_tool.search.dijkstra_search` provides a more efficient
    alternative. If all the edge weights are all equal, then
    :func:`~graph_tool.search.bfs_search` provides an even more efficient
    alternative.

    The Bellman-Ford algorithm proceeds by looping through all of the edges in
    the graph, applying the relaxation operation to each edge. In the following
    pseudo-code, ``v`` is a vertex adjacent to ``u``, ``w`` maps edges to their
    weight, and ``d`` is a distance map that records the length of the shortest
    path to each vertex seen so far. ``p`` is a predecessor map which records
    the parent of each vertex, which will ultimately be the parent in the
    shortest paths tree

    ::

        RELAX(u, v, w, d, p)
          if (w(u,v) + d[u] < d[v])
            d[v] := w(u,v) + d[u]       relax edge (u,v)
            p[v] := u
          else
            ...                         edge (u,v) is not relaxed


    The algorithm repeats this loop ``|V|`` times after which it is guaranteed
    that the distances to each vertex have been reduced to the minimum possible
    unless there is a negative cycle in the graph. If there is a negative cycle,
    then there will be edges in the graph that were not properly minimized. That
    is, there will be edges ``(u,v)`` such that ``w(u,v) + d[u] < d[v]``. The
    algorithm loops over the edges in the graph one final time to check if all
    the edges were minimized, returning true if they were and returning false
    otherwise.

    ::


        BELLMAN-FORD(G)
          for each vertex u in V
            d[u] := infinity
            p[u] := u
          end for
          for i := 1 to |V|-1
            for each edge (u,v) in E          examine edge (u,v)
              RELAX(u, v, w, d, p)
            end for
          end for
          for each edge (u,v) in E
            if (w(u,v) + d[u] < d[v])
              return (false, , )              edge (u,v) was not minimized
            else
              ...                             edge (u,v) was minimized
          end for
          return (true, p, d)

    The time complexity is :math:`O(V E)`.

    Examples
    --------

    We must define what should be done during the search by subclassing
    :class:`~graph_tool.search.BellmanFordVisitor`, and specializing the
    appropriate methods. In the following we will keep track of the edge
    minimizations.

                      (self.name[e.source()], self.name[e.target()]))

    Notes
    -----

    The :math:`A^*` algorithm is a heuristic graph search algorithm: an
    :math:`A^*` search is "guided" by a heuristic function. A heuristic function
    :math:`h(v)` is one which estimates the cost from a non-goal state (v) in
    the graph to some goal state, t. Intuitively, :math:`A^*` follows paths
    (through the graph) to the goal that are estimated by the heuristic function
    to be the best paths. Unlike best-first search, :math:`A^*` takes into
    account the known cost from the start of the search to v; the paths
    :math:`A^*` takes are guided by a function :math:`f(v) = g(v) + h(v)`, where
    :math:`h(v)` is the heuristic function, and :math:`g(v)` (sometimes denoted
    :math:`c(s, v)`) is the known cost from the start to v. Clearly, the
    efficiency of :math:`A^*` is highly dependent on the heuristic function with
    which it is used.

    The time complexity is :math:`O((E + V) \log V)`.

    The pseudo-code for the :math:`A^*` algorithm is listed below, with the
    annotated event points, for which the given visitor object will be called
    with the appropriate method.

          end while


    Examples
    --------

    We will use an irregular two-dimensional lattice as an example, where the
    heuristic function will be based on the euclidean distance to the target.

    The heuristic function will be defined as:

    .. testcode::

        def h(v, target, pos):
            return sqrt(sum((pos[v].a - pos[target].a) ** 2))

    where ``pos`` is the vertex position in the plane.

    We must define what should be done during the search by subclassing
    :class:`~graph_tool.search.AStarVisitor`, and specializing the appropriate
    methods. In the following we will keep track of the discovered vertices, and
    which edges were examined, as well as the predecessor tree. We will also
    abort the search when a given target vertex is found, by raising the
    :class:`~graph_tool.search.StopSearch` exception.

    .. testcode::

        class VisitorExample(gt.AStarVisitor):

            def __init__(self, touched_v, touched_e, target):
                self.touched_v = touched_v
                self.touched_e = touched_e
                self.target = target

            def discover_vertex(self, u):
                self.touched_v[u] = True

            def examine_edge(self, e):
                self.touched_e[e] = True

            def edge_relaxed(self, e):
                if e.target() == self.target:
                    raise gt.StopSearch()


    With the above class defined, we can perform the :math:`A^*` search as
    follows.

    .. testsetup::

        from numpy.random import seed, random
        import matplotlib.cm
        seed(42)

    >>> points = random((500, 2)) * 4
    >>> points[0] = [-0.01, 0.01]
    >>> points[1] = [4.01, 4.01]
    >>> g, pos = gt.triangulation(points, type="delaunay")
    >>> weight = g.new_edge_property("double") # Edge weights corresponding to
    ...                                        # Euclidean distances
    >>> for e in g.edges():
    ...    weight[e] = sqrt(sum((pos[e.source()].a -
    ...                          pos[e.target()].a) ** 2))
    >>> touch_v = g.new_vertex_property("bool")
    >>> touch_e = g.new_edge_property("bool")
    >>> target = g.vertex(1)
    >>> dist, pred = gt.astar_search(g, g.vertex(0), weight,
    ...                              VisitorExample(touch_v, touch_e, target),
    ...                              heuristic=lambda v: h(v, target, pos))

    We can now observe the best path found, and how many vertices and edges were
    visited in the process.

    >>> ecolor = g.new_edge_property("string")
    >>> ewidth = g.new_edge_property("double")
    >>> ewidth.a = 1
    >>> for e in g.edges():
    ...    ecolor[e] = "#3465a4" if touch_e[e] else "#d3d7cf"
    >>> v = target
    >>> while v != g.vertex(0):
    ...     p = g.vertex(pred[v])
    ...     for e in v.out_edges():
    ...         if e.target() == p:
    ...             ecolor[e] = "#a40000"
    ...             ewidth[e] = 3
    ...     v = p
    >>> gt.graph_draw(g, pos=pos, output_size=(300, 300), vertex_fill_color=touch_v,
    ...               vcmap=matplotlib.cm.binary, edge_color=ecolor,
    ...               edge_pen_width=ewidth, output="astar-delaunay.pdf")
    <...>

    .. testcode::
       :hide:

       gt.graph_draw(g, pos=pos, output_size=(300, 300), vertex_fill_color=touch_v,
                     vcmap=matplotlib.cm.binary, edge_color=ecolor,
                     edge_pen_width=ewidth, output="astar-delaunay.png")

       The shortest path is shown in red. The visited edges are shown in blue,
       and the visited vertices in black.


    The :math:`A^*` algorithm is very useful for searching *implicit* graphs,
    i.e. graphs which are not entirely stored in memory and are generated
    "on-the-fly" during the search. In the following example we will carry out a
    search in a hamming hypercube of 10 bits witch has random weights on its
    edges in the range :math:`[0,1]`. The vertices of the hypercube will be
    created during the search.

    The heuristic function will use the Hamming distance between vertices:

    .. testcode::

        def h(v, target, state):
            return sum(abs(state[v].a - target)) / 2


    In the following visitor we will keep growing the graph on-the-fly, and
    abort the search when a given target vertex is found, by raising the
    :class:`~graph_tool.search.StopSearch` exception.

    .. testcode::

        from numpy.random import random

        class HammingVisitor(gt.AStarVisitor):

            def __init__(self, g, target, state, weight, dist, cost):
                self.g = g
                self.state = state
                self.target = target
                self.weight = weight
                self.dist = dist
                self.cost = cost
                self.visited = {}

            def examine_vertex(self, u):
                for i in range(len(self.state[u])):
                    nstate = list(self.state[u])
                    nstate[i] ^= 1
                    if tuple(nstate) in self.visited:
                        v = self.visited[tuple(nstate)]
                    else:
                        v = self.g.add_vertex()
                        self.visited[tuple(nstate)] = v
                        self.state[v] = nstate
                        self.dist[v] = self.cost[v] = float('inf')
                    for e in u.out_edges():
                        if e.target() == v:
                            break
                    else:
                        e = self.g.add_edge(u, v)
                        self.weight[e] = random()
                self.visited[tuple(self.state[u])] = u

            def edge_relaxed(self, e):
                if self.state[e.target()] == self.target:
                    self.visited[tuple(self.target)] = e.target()
                    raise gt.StopSearch()

    With the above class defined, we can perform the :math:`A^*` search as
    follows.

    .. testsetup::

        from numpy.random import seed, random
        seed(42)

    ...                              implicit=True)

       The shortest path is shown in red, and the vertices which belong to it
       are in black. Note that the number of vertices visited is much smaller
       than the total number :math:`2^{10} = 1024`.
